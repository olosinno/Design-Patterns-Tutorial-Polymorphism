# Design-Patterns-Tutorial-Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows programmers to write methods that don't need to change if new subclasses are created. Example: a subclass Dog can add a new method such as dig without affecting superclass Animal in any way. Also, subclasses may be referred to by their superclass type. You can then create subclasses from subclasses. You cannot however access methods this way if they're only in the subclass.
